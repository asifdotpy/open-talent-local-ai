# OpenTalent Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how OpenTalent ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use the OpenTalent desktop application and related services (the "Service").

## 1. Our Core Privacy Principle

**OpenTalent is a desktop-first, privacy-first application.** Our core principle is that **your data is your own**. The Service is designed to run 100% locally on your hardware, meaning **no candidate data, interview transcripts, or user-generated content is ever transmitted to our servers or any third-party cloud services for processing or storage.**

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

Due to the local nature of the Service, we do not collect, store, or process the following types of information:

* **Candidate Data:** We do not collect names, contact information, resumes, interview transcripts, or any other data related to the candidates you source or interview. This data remains exclusively on your local machine.
* **User Content:** We do not collect or view the content of your AI interviews, search queries, or internal notes.
* **Usage Data (Non-Anonymized):** We do not track your specific activities within the application (e.g., which buttons you click, which candidates you view).

## 3. Information We May Collect (Anonymized)

We may collect minimal, anonymized, and aggregated data for the sole purpose of improving the application's stability and performance. This data is non-identifiable and includes:

* **Crash Reports:** If the application crashes, an anonymized report detailing the technical state of the application at the time of the crash may be generated. You will be prompted to approve sending this report.
* **Version Information:** We may check the application version to notify you of available updates.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

* **Local Storage:** All sensitive data, including candidate profiles and interview results, is stored exclusively on your local machine, typically within a dedicated directory (e.g., `~/OpenTalent/cache/`).
* **Encryption:** We encourage users to utilize their operating system's built-in encryption (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault) to protect the local storage directory. The Service itself employs industry-standard encryption for sensitive data at rest within its local database.
* **Microservices:** The Service utilizes a microservices architecture (e.g., `user-service`, `security-service`) which communicate only locally via internal network interfaces. No external communication channels are used for data transfer.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The Service is designed to minimize reliance on third parties.

* **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Model:** For certain features (e.g., sourcing from external APIs), the Service may require you to provide your own API keys. In this case, you are establishing a direct connection with the third-party provider (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub), and their respective privacy policies govern the data shared with them. OpenTalent does not act as a proxy or intermediary for this data.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
