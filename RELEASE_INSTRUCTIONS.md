## Task: Final Release Engineering & Production Readiness

You are tasked with finalizing the **OpenTalent** local-AI interview platform for its production release. The project has reached 90% technical completion but requires critical remediation of desktop-app blockers, backend schema implementation, and API gateway synchronization.

### 1. Context & Repository State

* **Architecture**: Electron (Desktop) + 14 Python Microservices (Backend) + Ollama (Local AI).
* **Current Status**: Phase 5 (Desktop Setup) / Week 4 (Outreach & Enrichment).
* **Core Docs**: Read `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for the latest architecture and setup instructions.

### 2. Technical Roadmap & Remediation (48-Hour Sprint)

| Phase | Duration | Objective | Critical Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Desktop Stabilization** | 12 Hours | **COMPLETED** (Final compilation check pending). | 1. Final compilation check (`tsc --noEmit`). |
| **Phase 2: Backend Hardening** | 18 Hours | **COMPLETED** (All schemas implemented and gateway config fixed). | 1. No remaining actions. |
| **Phase 3: Feature Exposure** | 12 Hours | Expose high-value endpoints via the API Gateway. | 1. Add gateway routes for Scout Service search (GitHub/LinkedIn). <br> 2. Add gateway routes for Voice Service TTS/STT streaming. <br> 3. Verify end-to-end flow from Desktop UI to Microservices. |
| **Phase 4: Release Verification** | 6 Hours | Run automated verification and package for release. | 1. Create and execute `verify-release.sh` (see below). <br> 2. Tag the repository and prepare the release branch. |

### 3. Automated Verification Scripts

Create and execute the following script (`verify-release.sh`) in the project root to ensure production readiness:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# OpenTalent Release Verification Script

echo "Starting OpenTalent Release Verification..."

# 1. Desktop App Compilation
echo "[1/4] Checking Desktop App Compilation..."
cd desktop-app && ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "✅ Desktop Compilation Passed"; else echo "❌ Desktop Compilation Failed"; exit 1; fi

# 2. Desktop App Tests
echo "[2/4] Running Desktop App Tests..."
./node_modules/.bin/jest --watchAll=false
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "✅ Desktop Tests Passed"; else echo "❌ Desktop Tests Failed"; exit 1; fi

# 3. Backend Gateway Health
echo "[3/4] Verifying API Gateway & Service Discovery.cd ../services/desktop-integration-service# Mock check for service registration
grep -q "scout-service" app/core/service_discovery.py
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "✅ Scout Service Registered"; else echo "❌ Scout Service Missing in Gateway"; exit 1; fi

# 4. Schema Verification
echo "[4/4] Verifying Critical Service Schemas..."
cd ../services/security-service
if [ -f "app/schemas.py" ]; then echo "✅ Security Schemas Found"; else echo "❌ Security Schemas Missing"; exit 1; fi

echo "🚀 ALL SYSTEMS GO: OpenTalent is ready for release!"
```

### 4. Final Deliverables

1. **Stable Codebase**: Zero TypeScript errors and 100% passing Jest/Pytest suites.
2. **Synchronized Gateway**: All 14 services correctly registered and reachable via port 8009.
3. **Complete Schemas**: Pydantic models implemented for all 271+ endpoints.
4. **Release Tag**: Repository tagged as `v1.0.0-release`.

**Constraint**: Do not introduce new features. Focus exclusively on stabilization, schema implementation, and integration synchronization. **Hands off agents**—ensure all logic is implemented in the core services.
