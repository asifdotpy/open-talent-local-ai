### Decentralized & Transparent Search Concept

**Idea:** Leverage OpenTalent's modular services for decentralized, transparent recruitment/search in web3 ecosystem.

**Key Features:**
- Decentralized candidate search and matching
- Transparent AI-driven assessment process
- Blockchain-verified credentials integration
- Community-governed evaluation standards

**Technical Approach:**
- Reuse conversation service for decentralized interviews

- Transparent audit trails on blockchain
- Opt-in participation with clear disclaimers

**Benefits:**
- Trustless recruitment process
- Global talent pool access
- Reduced bias through algorithmic transparency
- Community-driven quality standards

**Risks to Mitigate:**
- Platform misuse by bad actors
- Regulatory compliance challenges
- Scalability of decentralized infrastructure
