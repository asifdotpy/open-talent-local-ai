# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

OpenTalent is committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We pledge that everyone participating in our community—including, but not limited to attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, online participants, and other community participants—will be treated with respect and dignity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- Harassment of any kind
- Discrimination based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, political belief, profession, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or socioeconomic status
- Use of sexual language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which would reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Community leaders will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@opentalent.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
